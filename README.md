# Fluxora Frontend

React dashboard and recipient portal for the Fluxora treasury streaming protocol.

## What's in this repo

- **Dashboard** — Treasury overview, active streams, and capital flow summary
- **Streams** — Create and manage USDC streams (rate, duration, cliff)
- **Recipient Portal** — View incoming streams and withdraw accrued balance

The UI is wired for a future backend API and Stellar wallet integration.

## Theming

Light/dark theming is owned by a single `ThemeProvider` (`src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`),
which is the **only** place that writes the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

How a theme is chosen, in order:

1. A valid value persisted in `localStorage` under the `theme` key (an explicit
   user choice).
2. Otherwise, the OS preference via `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`.

Behavior:

- **No flash (FOUC):** `initTheme()` is called once in `src/main.tsx` to apply the
  resolved theme to `<html>` before React renders.
- **Follows the OS:** while the user has not made an explicit choice, the app tracks
  `prefers-color-scheme` changes live. Once the user toggles, their choice wins.
- **Cross-tab sync:** changing the theme in one tab updates all other open tabs via
  the `storage` event.
- **Hardened input:** only `"light"` and `"dark"` are accepted. Any tampered or
  corrupted `localStorage`/`storage` value is ignored, so it can never be written to
  the DOM (`data-theme`).

Consume it anywhere under the provider with the `useTheme()` hook:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "./theme/ThemeProvider";

function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} mode
    </button>
  );
}
```

`useTheme()` throws if used outside a `ThemeProvider`. The provider wraps the app in
`src/App.tsx`.

## Environment

Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) when you add API or Stellar config, for example:

- `VITE_API_URL` — Backend API base URL
- `VITE_NETWORK` — Stellar network (testnet / mainnet)
